# NLP-Sentiment-analysis
Sentiment Analysis.ipynb
Overview
This notebook demonstrates sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It includes preprocessing steps such as lexical and syntactic analysis, followed by sentiment classification into positive, negative, and neutral categories. The notebook uses Python libraries like NLTK, TextBlob, and Seaborn for text preprocessing, visualization, and sentiment labeling. Additionally, it explores advanced techniques like stemming, lemmatization, POS tagging, and topic modeling.

Features
1. Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning:

Converts text to lowercase.

Removes hyperlinks, @mentions, hashtags, and punctuation.

Filters out stop words using NLTK's stopwords.

Stemming and Lemmatization:

Reduces words to their root forms using Porter Stemmer.

Performs lemmatization with NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer.

2. Lexical Analysis
Tokenizes text into individual words using NLTK's word_tokenize.

Visualizes token frequency with Seaborn bar plots.

3. Syntactic Analysis
Performs POS tagging and dependency parsing using SpaCy.

Displays grammatical relationships between words.

4. Bag of Words (BoW) Model
Creates a BoW representation of the text data using CountVectorizer.

5. Sentiment Analysis
Uses TextBlob to calculate polarity scores for text data.

Labels sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral based on polarity values.

Visualizes sentiment distribution with count plots and pie charts.

6. Topic Modeling
Generates word clouds for positive and negative tweets to identify key themes.

Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required:

pandas: For handling tabular data.

numpy: For numerical computations.

matplotlib: For plotting visualizations.

seaborn: For advanced visualizations.

nltk: For text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal).

spacy: For POS tagging and dependency parsing.

TextBlob: For sentiment analysis.

WordCloud: For generating word clouds.

Installation
To install the required libraries, run:

bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk spacy textblob wordcloud
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Usage Instructions
Clone or download the notebook file to your local machine.

Place the dataset (vaccination_tweets.csv) in the appropriate directory.

Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run all cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

Key Sections
Text Preprocessing
Cleans text data by removing hyperlinks, @mentions, hashtags, and punctuation.

Applies stemming and lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.

Lexical Analysis
Visualizes token frequency before and after stopword removal.

Syntactic Analysis
Performs POS tagging and dependency parsing to analyze grammatical relationships.

Sentiment Analysis
Calculates polarity scores using TextBlob's sentiment analysis module.

Labels sentiment based on polarity values:

Positive: Polarity > 0

Negative: Polarity < 0

Neutral: Polarity = 0

Visualizes sentiment distribution with count plots and pie charts.

Topic Modeling
Generates word clouds for positive and negative tweets to identify key themes in the data.

Observations
Sentiment analysis reveals the overall emotional tone of tweets about vaccination.

Positive tweets highlight supportive opinions, while negative tweets focus on criticism or concerns.

Word clouds provide insights into common themes in positive and negative sentiments.

Future Improvements
Extend sentiment analysis to include deep learning models like transformers (e.g., BERT).

Implement advanced topic modeling techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

Explore emotion detection for more granular insights into customer opinions.
